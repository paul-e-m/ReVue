# ReVue VRO API Manual

## Overview

ReVue VRO exposes a local HTTP API used by:

- the main operator (VRO) UI in `index.html`, used by the ReVue VRO app
- the settings window in `config.html`, used by the ReVue VRO app
- the separate standalone ReVue Judge app in `ReVue-Judge/wwwroot/ReVue-Judge.html`

Base URL:

```text
http://localhost:5050
```

ReVue Judge clients use the ReVue VRO computer's LAN address, for example:

```text
http://192.168.6.60:5050
```

ReVue VRO listens on port `5050`, but access is split by purpose:

- ReVue Judge clients on the LAN can use only read-only replay endpoints.
- Operator-only pages and API actions are restricted to loopback (`127.0.0.1` / `localhost`) and require a disposable per-session bearer token.

The operator token is generated in memory when ReVue VRO starts. The native ReVue VRO shell injects it directly into the local WebView before the operator pages load; installers and operators do not configure passwords, QR codes, or shared secrets. The token is not exposed by any API endpoint.

External clients should not attempt to automate operator-only endpoints. They are intended for the local ReVue VRO UI only.

## Response Conventions

- Most endpoints return JSON.
- Media endpoints return MP4 files or HTML pages.
- Replay edit endpoints return the updated session status.

Common status codes:

- `200 OK`
- `400 Bad Request`
- `401 Unauthorized`: loopback operator request is missing the session bearer token
- `403 Forbidden`: endpoint is restricted to the ReVue VRO computer
- `404 Not Found`

## Access Model

### LAN Read-Only Endpoints

The following endpoints are available to ReVue Judge clients over the LAN:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| - | - | - |
| `GET` | `/api/status` | Get current session status |
| `GET` | `/api/sessionInfo` | Read current SessionInfo payload |
| `GET` | `/api/recording/file?kind=low-res&v=<ReplayMediaToken>` | Stream the low-res replay MP4 |

These endpoints do not allow recording control, clip marking, replay editing, configuration changes, diagnostics, or restart.

### Operator-Only Endpoints

All other app pages and API endpoints are local-only. They must be called from the ReVue VRO computer. API endpoints also require:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <operator-session-token>
```

The local operator UI receives the token from the native WebView shell at page startup. There is no API endpoint for retrieving the token, and the token changes every time the ReVue VRO server restarts.

## Canonical JSON Shapes

### AppConfig

`GET /api/appconfig` and `POST /api/appconfig` mostly use PascalCase property names. The low-res bitrate field uses the lower-case name shown below:

```json
{
  "Language": "en",
  "UiZoomPercent": 90,
  "ClipMarkerAdvanceMsec": 500,
  "DemoMode": true,
  "RtspUrl": "rtsp://192.168.6.200:8554/0",
  "SourceFps": 30,
  "RtspTransportProtocol": "UDP",
  "UseHardwareEncodingWhenAvailable": true,
  "highresVideoGop": 10,
  "lowresVideoBitrate": 2500,
  "lowresVideoGop": 60,
  "CSSLink": "Legacy",
  "DatabaseLocation": "localhost",
  "EventId": "",
  "CSSServerHost": "",
  "SaveVideos": false,
  "SavedVideosFolder": "C:/Event_Videos",
  "AutoplaySelectedClip": false
}
```

### SessionInfo

`GET /api/sessionInfo` returns the raw `SessionInfo.json` payload. The server does not map it into a fixed DTO, so unknown extra properties pass through unchanged. The current clients read the fields shown below:

```json
{
  "categoryName": "STAR 10",
  "categoryDiscipline": "Women",
  "categoryFlight": "Grp 1",
  "segmentName": "Free Program",
  "segmentProgHalfTime": "1:30",
  "competitorFirstName": "Cindy",
  "competitorLastName": "Smith",
  "competitorClub": "Example Club",
  "competitorSection": "ON",
  "elements": {
    "1": {
      "code": "2A",
      "base_code": "2A",
      "review": false
    },
    "2": {
      "code": "LSp4",
      "base_code": "LSp",
      "review": true
    }
  }
}
```

Known top-level fields:

| Field | Used for |
| - | - |
| `categoryName` | Session banner, halfway/program timing eligibility, saved-video folder naming |
| `categoryDiscipline` | Session banner, halfway/program timing eligibility, saved-video folder naming |
| `categoryFlight` | Session banner and saved-video folder naming |
| `segmentName` | Session banner, halfway/program timing eligibility, saved-video folder naming |
| `segmentProgHalfTime` | Halfway/program timing marker; accepts seconds, `m:ss`, or `h:mm:ss` |
| `competitorFirstName` | Session banner and saved-video file naming |
| `competitorLastName` | Session banner and saved-video file naming |
| `competitorClub` | Saved-video file naming |
| `competitorSection` | Saved-video file naming |
| `elements` | Numbered element metadata keyed by element number |

Known `elements[n]` fields:

| Field | Used for |
| - | - |
| `code` | Element label in the local ReVue VRO operator UI |
| `base_code` | Element label in the ReVue Judge client |
| `review` | Review flag; review-marked clips are highlighted and remembered by the backend |

### Status

`GET /api/status` and most replay-edit endpoints return:

```json
{
  "mode": "replay",
  "isArming": false,
  "isRecording": false,
  "recordingDurationSeconds": 42.6,
  "programTimerStartOffsetSeconds": 4.0,
  "replayMediaToken": "6f7f9f8df8a146c897dce3239f9b7976",
  "clips": [
    {
      "index": 1,
      "startSeconds": 4.2,
      "endSeconds": 6.8,
      "everMarkedForReview": false
    }
  ],
  "openClipStartSeconds": null,
  "canUndoClipAction": false,
  "canRedoClipAction": false,
  "sourceFps": 60
}
```

### GET `/api/appconfig`

Access: operator-only.

Returns the current `AppConfig` object in PascalCase.

### POST `/api/appconfig`

```

## SessionInfo

### GET `/api/sessionInfo`

Access: LAN read-only.

Returns the current `SessionInfo.json` contents unchanged. See [SessionInfo](#sessioninfo) for the known fields currently read by ReVue VRO and ReVue Judge.

If CSS link mode is `None`, or if the file is missing, the server returns:

```json
{
  "elements": {}
}
```

The endpoint also updates backend review history so replay clips can stay marked after playback begins.

## Recording

### POST `/api/record/start`

Access: operator-only.

Starts recording.

Request body:

```json
{
  "demoStartSeconds": 12.4
}
```

`demoStartSeconds` is used only in demo mode.

Returns the current status object.

### POST `/api/record/stop`

Access: operator-only.

Stops recording and finalizes replay assets.

Request body:

```json
{
  "uiElapsedSeconds": 38.2,
  "programTimerStartOffsetSeconds": 4.0
}
```

`programTimerStartOffsetSeconds` is optional. When supplied, replay clients can show timeline values relative to the operator's Set Start point, including negative timeline values before that point.

Returns the current status object.

### POST `/api/record/clipToggle`

Access: operator-only.

Starts or stops the current clip marker.

Request body:

```json
{
  "nowSeconds": 14.7
}
```

Returns the current status object.

### POST `/api/record/undo`

Access: operator-only.

Deletes a completed clip while still in record mode.

Request body:

```json
{
  "index": 3
}
```

Returns the current status object.

### POST `/api/session/clear`

Access: operator-only.

Stops any running recorder, deletes the current replay files, resets session state, and returns the cleared status.

## Replay File Delivery

### GET `/api/recording/file`

Streams the current replay MP4 with range support.

Query options:

- no query string or `?kind=high-res`: high-res operator replay file, operator-only
- `?kind=low-res`: low-res ReVue Judge and saved-video replay file, LAN read-only when paired with a current replay token
- `v=<ReplayMediaToken>`: required for low-res replay requests

Low-res requests should include the current replay media token as `v=<ReplayMediaToken>`. If the token is stale, the server returns `404 Not Found`.

Operator high-res replay requests are served directly and are available only on the ReVue VRO computer. ReVue Judge low-res requests are demand-driven and enter the ReVue Judge transfer path. The backend does not preload, throttle, or cap concurrent ReVue Judge transfers.

ReVue VRO records both files while the recording is in progress. `current-high-res.mp4` is encoded with the configured `highresVideoGop`, which is the high-res/operator replay GOP; `current-low-res.mp4` is encoded as 720p/30 fps with the configured `lowresVideoGop` and `lowresVideoBitrate` values. When `SaveVideos` is enabled, the low-res file also includes AAC audio from the source for saved copies; ReVue Judge clients keep playback muted. When `UseHardwareEncodingWhenAvailable` is enabled and supported hardware is available, both files use the same hardware encoder. Otherwise both use software encoding.

## ReVue Judge App

The remote ReVue Judge UI is packaged in the separate ReVue Judge app under `ReVue-Judge/wwwroot`. It loads locally inside `ReVue-Judge.exe` and uses the ReVue VRO backend API endpoints `/api/status`, `/api/sessionInfo`, and `/api/recording/file`.

Run `ReVue-Judge.exe` on each judge or referee computer. In the app settings, set the Server IP address to the computer running ReVue VRO.

ReVue Judge is read-only over the LAN. It cannot call operator-only recording, clip marking, replay editing, settings, diagnostics, or restart endpoints.

Query options:

- `autoplay=false` or `a=false`: disable initial autoplay.
- `loop=false` or `l=false`: disable looping the selected clip.
- `timer=true` or `tm=true`: show the ReVue Judge timer control.

ReVue Judge behavior:

- element rail buttons 1-15 represent clipped element regions
- element rail buttons are clickable immediately
- clicking an element clip autoplays that clipped region on a loop
- the video icon button beneath the element rail appears when replay media is available and opens the full-video timeline with blue numbered clip markers
- ReVue Judge clients cache chunks on demand as playback or seeking requests them
- cached chunks are reused, so repeated playback of the same region does not download the same bytes again
- full ReVue Judge mode shows a session info bar when replay clips are available
- the session info bar includes the category, discipline, flight, segment, competitor name, and a refresh button
- the ReVue Judge timer range is drawn above element clip blocks and remains translucent

`judge.html` has been removed; use the ReVue Judge app for remote replay.
